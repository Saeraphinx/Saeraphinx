hey, my names Saera, and i make some really bad programs. they seem to always get caught by anti virus programs, and i have put zero effort into finding out why.

my popular (and only public projects) include: 

 - [NyaDesktop](https://github.com/Saeraphinx/NyaDesktop), a port of the Nya Mod for Beat Saber for desktop (in case you dont want to play beat saber for some reason. if you like catgirls this is the app for you. do note that if you like saving these pictures, then oh boy are you going to need a big hard drive
 - [BeatSaberDiscordLink](https://github.com/Saeraphinx/BeatSaberDiscordLink), essentially the mod for twitch but for discord and uses oneclick instead.
 - [8](https://github.com/Saeraphinx/8) (You should play The Stanley Parable).
 
i do not promise that they work at all though.
